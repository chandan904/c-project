Project Report: Simple Traffic System (student)

Overview
- Project: Simple Traffic System — small C program simulating vehicle registration,
	recording traffic violations, marking penalties paid, and producing basic reports.
- Purpose: educational; simplified code intended for a first-semester B.Tech student.

Repository layout
- `include/` : header files (`vehicle.h`, `violation.h`, `penalty.h`, `reports.h`).
- `src/` : source files (`main.c`, `vehicle.c`, `violation.c`, `penalty.c`, `reports.c`).
- Data files (created at runtime): `vehicles.txt`, `violations.txt`.

Work performed
- Diagnosed initial build failures caused by missing or empty source/header files.
- Restored missing implementations for vehicle, violation, penalty, and reports modules.
- Removed duplicate symbol definitions (resolved multiple-definition linker error).
- Simplified all source and header files to short, beginner-friendly implementations.
- Added a `README.md` with build/run instructions and a sample smoke-test command.

Key design decisions
- Use plain text files for persistence to keep the code simple to understand.
- Minimal parsing using `fgets`, `sscanf`, and `strtok`-style patterns where needed.
- Single-responsibility C files: each module handles its own file I/O and simple logic.

Testing performed
- Built with: `gcc src/*.c -Iinclude -o main` (successful after fixes).
- Ran a quick smoke test: program shows menu and exits correctly. Further automated
	smoke tests can be executed by piping pre-prepared input into `./main`.

Known limitations
- No concurrent access handling for data files.
- Minimal input validation; assumes reasonably formatted input from the user.
- No unit tests or Makefile included (can be added on request).

Next steps (recommended)
- Add a simple `Makefile` with `build` and `clean` targets for students.
- Add short inline comments to each function explaining purpose and flow.
- Run a full scripted smoke test (add vehicle → record violation → mark paid → reports)
	and save its output as an example run in `docs/`.

Contact
- If you want, I can implement the next steps: add `Makefile`, comments, or run the
	full smoke test and commit the results.
